## :pencil2: Features

- Add `previous_state` attribute to restrict when an action is performed depending on the previous state of the entity. This is just applicable for `state` and `z2m` (with not MQTT) integrations. [#366]
- Add `cover_duration` attribute. Duration of the cover to open and/or close in seconds, so `toggle_open` and `toggle_close` can stop the cover if the cover is still moving. This is recommended to be used when the cover does not report `opening` and `closing` states, otherwise, it is not necessary. [#368]
